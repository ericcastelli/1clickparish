# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of the OneClickParish project, we pledge to orient our collaboration toward the love of God and neighbor. We commit to upholding the God-given dignity of every person who participates in this work, which is undertaken for the good of the Church.

Our interactions will be guided by the virtues of charity, patience, and humility, with the goal of creating a focused, welcoming, and holy environment where this important mission can flourish.

## Our Standards

Inspired by the Gospel, we aim to cultivate a community marked by the following behaviors:

*   **Practicing Charity and Kindness:** Treating every person with respect, patience, and goodwill, seeing Christ in them.
*   **Upholding Dignity:** Respecting differing opinions and technical approaches. When disagreements arise, we address the idea, not the person, without resorting to insults, public or private harassment, or other uncharitable behavior.
*   **Exercising Humility:** Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback. We are all here to serve the project's mission, and we accept responsibility for our mistakes, seek forgiveness, and learn from them.
*   **Working for the Common Good:** Focusing on what is best for the project's mission and the parishes we serve.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

*   The use of profane, impure, or sexualized language or imagery.
*   Insulting, derogatory, or inflammatory comments (trolling).
*   Personal attacks, calumny, or detraction.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
*   Any other conduct contrary to Christian charity.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of conduct. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem to be uncharitable, disruptive, or harmful to the community and its mission.

Project leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the OneClickParish community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the project leaders at `TBD`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated with prudence and justice.

The privacy of the reporter will be respected.
